The Final Project consists of 2 automations () & {} joined together as follows:
(AutoIT: Trello - Testrail[ - Mantis] - {SeleniumC#): - Tests - eMail} 5 minutes total.
With this automation I would like to simulate a real life scenario on the job.
For the program to run on your computer see the requirements in C0TestCaseFinalProject.txt.
Variables used are mostly of strings and
in a disabled (commented) If-Else section of the code I used one more variable for storing a colour
which is then converted into hexadecimal.
In SeleniumC# I mostly used string variables again for storing and retrieving web elements for easy access
In AutoIT for navigating I tried to use Tabs instead of Clicks everywhere possible.
In SeleniumC# I used Assert method for testing the correct state of certain elements.
" I used Xpath where identifying web elements by id/class/name etc. were not possible.
See in comments of the code the steps that it takes or more detailed inside C0TestCaseFinalProject.txt.
The program consists of about 250 lines of code (AutoIT + SeleniumC#).

Enjoy the short jurney of our tester robot! :)
